This is the folder to hold the firmware for Nordic nRF51822 chips, to act as temperature sensor.
The folder has two sub-folders:
1. SDK - this is the entire Nordic SDK, and has our project alongwith the libraries required for nRF operation.
2. SoftDevice - this is the BLE library, separately available pre-compiled.
